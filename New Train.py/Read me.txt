This folder simply has a copy of train.py from stylegan2-ada
When trying to run the train.py which was cloned directly from the stylegan2-ada folder
for some reason there was a missing piece of code which made it so i couldnt run it
so the clunky fix that i had to use is to simply replace the broken train.py with a fixed one
(i.e the one in this folder)
